Hello there! My name is Dimitrios - Georgios Kontopoulos and I am 
an <b>evolutionary thermal biologist</b>.

<br><br>
I started with a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from the 
<a href="http://mbg.duth.gr/index.php/en/">Democritus University of 
Thrace</a>, followed by an MRes in Biodiversity Informatics and 
Genomics from Imperial College London. I then 
pursued a PhD degree at Imperial College London (primarily 
supervised by <a href="http://pawarlab.org">Samraat Pawar</a>), in 
which I examined likely constraints on thermal adaptation, 
mainly across microbial species.
<br><br>
I am currently an <b>EMBO postdoctoral fellow</b> at the 
<a href="https://tbg.senckenberg.de/personen/hiller/">Hiller group of LOEWE-TBG</a>, 
investigating the genomic, physiological, and ecological drivers of 
dormancy across birds and mammals.
