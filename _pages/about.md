Hello there! My name is Dimitrios - Georgios Kontopoulos and I would like to 
welcome you to my website!
<br><br>
If you are looking for a short bio, I originally graduated with a 
BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from the 
<a href="http://mbg.duth.gr/index.php/en/">Democritus University of 
Thrace</a>. I then proceeded to do a MRes in Biodiversity Informatics and 
Genomics at Imperial College London, which I completed with Distinction. 
Following this, I pursued a PhD degree at Imperial College London (primarily 
supervised by <a href="http://pawarlab.org">Samraat Pawar</a>), in 
which I examined likely constraints on thermal adaptation, mainly across microbial 
species.
<br><br>
I am currently doing a postdoc at the 
<a href="https://tbg.senckenberg.de/personen/hiller/">Hiller group of LOEWE-TBG</a>, 
working on comparative genomics of mammals and birds adapted to different 
thermal environments.
