Hello there! My name is Dimitrios - Georgios Kontopoulos and I would like to 
welcome you to my website!
<br><br>
If you are looking for a short bio, I originally graduated with a 
BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from the 
<a href="http://mbg.duth.gr/index.php/en/">Democritus University of 
Thrace</a>. I then proceeded to do a MRes in Biodiversity Informatics and 
Genomics at Imperial College London, which I completed with Distinction. 
Following this, I pursued a PhD degree at Imperial College London (from 2015 to 2019), in 
which I examined likely constraints on the ability of 
ectotherms to adapt to various thermal environments.
